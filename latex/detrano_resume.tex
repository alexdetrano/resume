% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

	\begin{tightemize}
		\item Pre-silicon security assurance for Intel architectures across a variety of market segments (client chipset, wearables, IOT, automative)
		\item Threat modeling, risk assessment, vulnerability analysis, design and implementation review for a number of Intel products 
		\item Participate in hardware/firmware/software hackathons 
		\item Collaborate with cross-discipline teams in multiple geolocations to recommend bugfixes and ultimately resolve security vulnerabilities
		\item Developed a tool in Python to speed-up reviewing register files

	\begin{tightemize}
		\item Developed hardware security guidance for 3rd-Party IP (3PIP) providers.  The guidance focused on actionable insights that a 3PIP provider with no security knowledge could use to reduce the most common pre-silicon bugs.
		\item The 3PIP HW security guidance was added as part of Intel's Secure Design Lifecycle.
		\item Developed a tool in Python to help automate many tasks involved in performing security validation of IPs.  The tool provided an easy way to scrub IP assets.

	\descript{| NYU}
	\location{2014 | New York, NY}
	\begin{tightemize}
		\item Recovered the secret encryption key from a masked implementation of AES-256 on an Atmel ATMega-163
		smart-card using 15 power traces
		\item First attack targeted the loading of the masks from memory, and recovered the mask with 91\% success
		\item Second attack identified collisions between two AES S-Boxes and recovered the difference between bytes of the key, reducing brute-force attack complexity from $2^{128}$ to $2^{8}$ 
		\item Both attacks coded in MATLAB and were accepted to the \href{(http://www.dpacontest.org/home/index.html}{DPA Contest V4}.
