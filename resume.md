# Experience
## Security Researcher
* Intel Corp (2015 - Present)
* Pre-silicon security assurance for Intel architectures (client chipset, wearables, IOT, automative)
* Threat modeling, risk assessment, vulnerability analysis, secure code reviews for a number of hardware/firmware/software Intel products
* Languages: Verilog, SystemVerilog, Python, C, C++, x86 assembly, ARM assembly, Java, shell scripting (bash)
* Tools: Verdi, DVE, DVT, JasperGold Formal Property Verification, JasperGold Security Path Verification

## Security Validation Engineering Intern
* Intel Corp. (2015)
* Developed hardware security guidance for 3rd-Party IP (3PIP) providers.  The guidance focused on actionable insights that a 3PIP provider with no security knowledge could use to reduce the most common pre-silicon bugs.
* The 3PIP HW security guidance was added as part of Intel's Secure Design Lifecycle.
* Developed a tool in Python to help automate many tasks involved in performing security validation of IPs.  The tool provided an easy way to scrub IP assets.

## Data Analyst
* E\*TRADE Financial Corp. (2012-2013)
* Created holistic analysis by combining data from different sources for presentations to senior management and business-unit leaders
* Used insights from the data to identify revenue generating opportunities and inform multivariate tests that drive fundamental improvements to the website experience

## Senior Business Intelligence Analyst
* AvePoint, Inc. (2011-2012)
* Developed multiple cross-functional reports used to identify important business trends and facilitate business planning process by upper management
* Created a multi-touch marketing ROI model to provide analysis and guidance on campaign performance that resulted in increased sales pipeline

* Strategically managed pay-per-click campaigns to improve campaign performance (improved click-through-rate by 55%

# Projects
## Attacking a Masked Software Implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
* Recovered the secret encryption key from a masked implementation of AES-256 on an Atmel ATMega-163
smart-card using 15 power traces
* First attack targeted the loading of the masks from memory, and recovered the mask with 91% success
* Second attack identified collisions between two AES S-Boxes and recovered the difference between bytes of
the key, reducing brute-force attack complexity from 2128 to 28
* Both attacks coded in MATLAB and were accepted to the [DPA Contest V4](http://www.dpacontest.org/home/index.html).
