Experience
==========
Security Researcher
-------------------
* Intel Corp (2015 - Present)
* Pre-silicon security assurance for Intel architectures across a variety of market segments (client chipset, wearables, IOT, automotive, artificial intelligence)
* Threat modeling, risk assessment, vulnerability analysis, design and implementation review for a number of Intel products 
* Participate in hardware/firmware/software hackathons 
* Recommend security vulnerability fixes and collaborate with cross-discipline teams in multiple geolocations to resolve security issues 
* Developed a tool in Python to speed-up reviewing register files 

Security Validation Engineering Intern
--------------------------------------
* Intel Corp. (2015)
* Developed hardware security guidance for 3rd-Party IP (3PIP) providers.  The guidance focused on actionable insights that a 3PIP provider with no security knowledge could use to reduce the most common pre-silicon bugs.
* The 3PIP HW security guidance was added as part of Intel's Secure Design Lifecycle.
* Developed a tool in Python which provided an easy way to validate IP assets

Projects
========
Attacking a Masked Software Implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Recovered the secret encryption key from a masked implementation of AES-256 on an Atmel ATMega-163
smart-card using 15 power traces
* First attack targeted the loading of the masks from memory, and recovered the mask with 91% success
* Second attack identified collisions between two AES S-Boxes and recovered the difference between bytes of
the key, reducing brute-force attack complexity from 2^128^ to 2^8^
* Both attacks coded in MATLAB and were accepted to the [DPA Contest V4](http://www.dpacontest.org/home/index.html).
